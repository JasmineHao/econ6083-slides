- **Naive ATE:** $[value]
- **95% Confidence Interval:** [$lower, $upper]

**Interpretation (2-3 sentences):**

- **Maximum CATE:** $[value]
- **Median CATE:** $[value]
- **Interquartile Range:** [$p25, $p75]

**Initial observations (2-3 sentences):**

[How much heterogeneity exists? How does mean CATE compare to naive ATE? What is the range of treatment effects?]

---

### 2.2 Heterogeneity Visualizations

[Insert heterogeneity_analysis.png here or describe all 4 plots]

**Analysis of Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (150-200 words):**

Based on the visualizations:

1. **CATE Distribution:**
   [Describe the shape of the distribution. Is it roughly normal? Are there outliers?]

2. **CATE vs Education:**
   [What pattern do you observe? Do individuals with lower education benefit more/less? Why might this be?]

3. **CATE vs Prior Earnings:**
   [What pattern do you observe? Do low-income, middle-income, or high-income workers benefit most? Why?]

4. **CATE by Education Level:**
   [Compare high school dropouts (education < 12) to others. What is the difference in average CATE? What explains this?]

**Economic Interpretation:**
[Which characteristics are associated with higher treatment effects? Provide an economic explanation for why these patterns might exist. For example: "Low-educated workers may benefit more because they have larger skill gaps that training can address..."]

[Word count: ___ / 150-200]

## Part III: Policy Analysis (50 points)

### 3.1 High Responders Characterization (15 points)

**Percentage with CATE > $3,000:** [X]%

**Table: High vs Low Responders**

[Insert comparison table from code output]

| Characteristic | High Responders (CATE > p75) | Low Responders (CATE < p25) | Difference |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Age            | [value]                      | [value]                    | [value]    |
| Education      | [value]                      | [value]                    | [value]    |
| Prior Earnings | [value]                      | [value]                    | [value]    |
| % Female       | [value]                      | [value]                    | [value]    |

**Interpretation (3-4 sentences):**

[Describe the characteristics of high responders. Are they younger/older? More/less educated? Higher/lower prior earnings? What does this tell us about who benefits most from job training?]

---

### 3.2 Targeting Policy Design (20 points)

**Scenario:** Budget allows training only 30% of applicants.

**Policy Comparison:**

| Policy | Average CATE | Total Gain (600 treated) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Random Selection (30%)** | $[value] | $[value] |
| **Targeted Selection (Top 30%)** | $[value] | $[value] |

**Policy Gains:**

- **Absolute gain:** $[value] per person
- **Percentage gain:** [value]%
- **Extra earnings generated:** $[value] (for 600 people treated)

**Analysis (3-4 sentences):**

[Is targeting effective? How much more effective is it than random selection? Is the gain substantial enough to justify the cost of implementing a targeting system?]

---

### 3.3 Policy Evaluation (15 points)

#### 3.3.1 Efficiency Gain

**Question:** If the program budget is $1 million (enough to train 200 people at $5,000 each), how much additional earnings are generated by targeting vs random selection?

**Answer:**

[Calculate: 200 × (targeted_ate - random_ate)]

**Economic interpretation (2-3 sentences):**

[Explain what this gain means. Is it substantial? What are the opportunity costs?]

---

#### 3.3.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Training cost per person:** $5,000

**Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis:**

| Policy | Avg CATE | Net Benefit | ROI | Cost-Effective? |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Top 30% | $[value] | $[value] | [%] | [Yes/No] |
| Top 50% | $[value] | $[value] | [%] | [Yes/No] |

**Formula:** ROI = (CATE - Cost) / Cost × 100%

**Analysis (3-4 sentences):**

[Is the program cost-effective under any policy? If not, what would need to change (lower cost or different targeting)? Should the program be implemented?]

---

#### 3.3.3 Equity Concerns

**Characteristics of Selected vs Not Selected (Top 30% policy):**

| Characteristic | Selected | Not Selected | Difference |
|----------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Age            | [value]  | [value]      | [value]    |
| Education      | [value]  | [value]      | [value]    |
| Prior Earnings | [value]  | [value]      | [value]    |
| % Female       | [value]  | [value]      | [value]    |

**Equity Discussion (100-150 words):**

[Who gets left behind under a targeting policy? Are there fairness concerns? For example:
- Are low-educated workers more likely to be selected? Is this fair?
- Are women under/over-represented among selected individuals?
- Does targeting exacerbate existing inequalities or help reduce them?
- What are the trade-offs between efficiency (maximizing total gains) and equity (ensuring fair access)?]

#### 3.3.4 Sensitivity Analysis

**Table: Policy Performance Across Different Targeting Levels**

| Targeting Level | Avg CATE (Targeted) | Avg CATE (Random) | Absolute Gain | Gain % |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| Top 20%         | $[value]            | $[value]          | $[value]      | [%]    |
| Top 30%         | $[value]            | $[value]          | $[value]      | [%]    |
| Top 40%         | $[value]            | $[value]          | $[value]      | [%]    |
| Top 50%         | $[value]            | $[value]          | $[value]      | [%]    |

**Analysis (3-4 sentences):**

[How do gains change as you expand the targeting threshold? Is there a trade-off between targeting precision and coverage? What targeting level would you recommend?]

---
